### 👋 Hi there, I'm Shivang Raj Shivhare

As a frontend developer, I specialize in building scalable and intuitive web applications using modern JavaScript technologies. My core strengths lie in **JavaScript**, **React.js**, and the **MERN stack**, with production-level experience in **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, enabling me to craft sleek, performant, and responsive user interfaces.

Whether it's designing a real-time academic collaboration platform, optimizing API performance, or creating e-commerce solutions with seamless user flows, I love solving real-world problems with clean code and thoughtful UX.

I’m committed to continuous learning, keeping up with the latest frontend trends, and contributing to impactful projects. My adaptability and attention to detail make me a reliable team player who’s always ready to build, improve, and collaborate.
